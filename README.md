Time to Play Ball!
Once you input your team name and its 3 players you will play 3 innings of baseball, with the goal of outscoring your opponent!
Each hitter has a different ability and will hit for different amounts of power and contact.
To play you choose a number between 1 and 4 for each pitch.
    1 means you think the pitch will be a fastball
    2 means you think the pitch will be a curveball
    3 means you think the pitch will be a slider
    4 means you think the pitch will be a ball

If you guess the pitch correctly (or take a ball) you will possibly be awarded a hit, depending on the type of hitter and pitch.

If you guess wrong (or swing at a ball) you will receieve a strike
3 strikes you're out, 3 outs the inning is over.

'X' symbolizes the base is empty, while 'O' symbolizes the base is occupied.
